# Read before grading!!!

This project is made with next.js version 13.2, typescript and tailwind hosted on vercel instead of netlify.
I have contacted teachers and gained permission to use this tech for this spesiffic assignment.

The reason for this choice is because there is a demand for next.js 13 and typescript on the market,
and the reason we go to school is to get a job.

Furthermore, vercel seem to handle next.js better than netlify, although it works fine on netlify as well.

When it comes to use of router, next.js has a slightly different routing system which is based on file location and name.
Bellow is an older project to proove that i understand routing in normal React.js:
Netlify link: https://react-cart-johann-ranudd.netlify.app/
Github repo: https://github.com/johannranudd/cart

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
